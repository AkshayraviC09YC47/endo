This package exists to verify that the compartment mapper follows symbolic
links to the original location of a package and looks up that package's
dependencies from  its real location.
In this case, `evan` is a symbolic link from `node_modules/app/node_modules`
and would not be able to find its own `node_modules/evan/node_modules/evankin`
if its dependencies were resolved from the link's location.

Furthermore, the `evankin` package contains a dependency on `evan`, and
although that `evan` has the same version number, the code is not the same.
This test verifies that a solution can be made with two packages with different
code and the same name and version.

Just in case that's not bad enough, `evankin` uses `export * from`.
